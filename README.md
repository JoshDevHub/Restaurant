# Restaurant

A small website of a fake coffee shop.

## Features

This is just a simple business-type site for a made up coffee shop. I used this as an opportunity to practice with webpack, and nearly all of the content on the site is generated via JavaScript.

The site itself just has a simple landing page, a menu page, and a contact page.

## Special Thanks

I used several images through this to get used to incorporating them into a site via webpack. Below I've credited the photographers for the various photos I used:
